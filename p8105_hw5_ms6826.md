## Problem 1

Suppose you put 𝑛people in a room, and want to know the probability that
at least two people share a birthday. For simplicity, we’ll assume there
are no leap years (i.e. there are only 365 days) and that birthdays are
uniformly distributed over the year (which is actually not the case).
Write a function that, for a fixed group size, randomly draws
“birthdays” for each person; checks whether there are duplicate
birthdays in the group; and returns TRUE or FALSE based on the result.

``` r
bday_sim= function(n) {
  
  bdays= sample(1:365, size=n, replace = TRUE)

  duplicate= length(unique(bdays))<n
  
  return(duplicate)
  
}
```

Next, run this function 10000 times for each group size between 2 and
50. For each group size, compute the probability that at least two
people in the group will share a birthday by averaging across the 10000
simulation runs. Make a plot showing the probability as a function of
group size, and comment on your results.

``` r
sim_res=
  expand.grid(
    n = 2:50,
    iter= 1:1000
  ) |> 
  mutate(res=map_lgl(n, bday_sim)) |> 
  group_by(n) |> 
  summarize(prob=mean(res))

sim_res |> 
  ggplot(aes(x= n, y = prob)) +
  geom_line()
```

group size increases, the probability of duplicate birthdays also
increases.

## Problem 2

First set the following design elements: Fix 𝑛=30 Fix 𝜎=5 Set 𝜇=0 .
Generate 5000 datasets from the model

𝑥∼𝑁𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑙\[𝜇,𝜎\]

For each dataset, save 𝜇̂ and the p-value arising from a test of 𝐻:𝜇=0
using 𝛼=0.05. Hint: to obtain the estimate and p-value, use broom::tidy
to clean the output of t.test.

``` r
sim_power= function(samp_size=30, true_mean=0, true_sd=5, alpha=0.05) {
  sim_df=
    tibble(
      x=rnorm(samp_size, true_mean,true_sd)
    )
  
   out_df=
    sim_df |> 
    summarize(
      mu_hat=mean(x),
      p_value=t.test(x, mu=0) |> broom::tidy() |> 
     pull(p.value)
    ) 
    
    
   return(out_df)
  
}

sim_results_df=
  expand_grid(
    iter= 1:5000
  ) |> 
  mutate(power_df=map(iter, sim_power, samp_size=30, true_mean=0)
         ) |> 
  unnest(power_df)
print(sim_results_df)
```

    ## # A tibble: 5,000 × 3
    ##     iter mu_hat p_value
    ##    <int>  <dbl>   <dbl>
    ##  1     1 -0.134  0.438 
    ##  2     2  0.299  0.410 
    ##  3     3  0.888  0.147 
    ##  4     4 -1.37   0.0930
    ##  5     5  0.572  0.548 
    ##  6     6 -1.14   0.368 
    ##  7     7  1.38   0.371 
    ##  8     8 -2.45   0.173 
    ##  9     9 -0.271  0.876 
    ## 10    10 -2.84   0.0622
    ## # ℹ 4,990 more rows

Repeat the above for 𝜇={1,2,3,4,5,6}

``` r
sim_final=
  expand_grid(
    true_mean=c(0,1,2,3,4,5,6),
    iter=1:5000
  ) |> 
  mutate(samp_res=map(true_mean, sim_power, samp_size=30)) |> 
  unnest(samp_res)
```

Make a plot showing the average estimate of 𝜇̂ on the y axis and the true
value of 𝜇on the x axis.

``` r
sim_final |> 
  group_by(true_mean) |> 
  summarize(avg_mu_hat=mean(mu_hat), .groups = 'drop') |> 
  ggplot(aes(x=true_mean, y=avg_mu_hat))+
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Average Estimate of μ hat vs. True Value of μ",
    x = "True Value of μ",
    y = "Average Estimate of μ hat"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

![](p8105_hw5_ms6826_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)<!-- -->

Make a second plot (or overlay on the first) the average estimate of 𝜇̂
only in samples for which the null was rejected on the y axis and the
true value of 𝜇on the x axis.

``` r
sim_final |> 
  filter(p_value<0.05) |> 
  group_by(true_mean) |> 
  summarize(avg_mu_hat_rejected=mean(mu_hat), .groups = 'drop') |> 
  ggplot(aes(x=true_mean, y=avg_mu_hat_rejected))+
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Average Estimate of μ hat vs. True Value of μ in Samples Where the Null was Rejected",
    x = "True Value of μ",
    y = "Average Estimate of μ hat"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

![](p8105_hw5_ms6826_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)<!-- --> –No
the sample average of mu hat across tests for which the null is rejected
is NOT approximately equal to the true value of mu, and this is expected
because any sample where the statistical test is rejected means that the
estimated mu was significantly different (with the significance
level=0.05) than the true value of mu.

## Problem 3

Describe the raw data. —The raw data for each homicide includes an ID#
that lists the first three letters of the city the homicide took place
as well as its \# on this list of 52,169 homicides.The raw data also
includes the reported date of the homicide, the location of the homicide
(city, state, lat, long), demographic information on the victim (e.g.,
first name, last name, race, age, etc.), as well as the disposition.

Create a city_state variable (e.g. “Baltimore, MD”) and then summarize
within cities to obtain the total number of homicides and the number of
unsolved homicides (those for which the disposition is “Closed without
arrest” or “Open/No arrest”).

``` r
homicide_df=
  read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv") 
```

    ## Rows: 52179 Columns: 12
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (9): uid, victim_last, victim_first, victim_race, victim_age, victim_sex...
    ## dbl (3): reported_date, lat, lon
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
hom_df=
homicide_df |> 
  mutate(city_state=paste(city, state, sep=", ")) |> 
  group_by(city_state) |> 
  summarize(
    tot_homicides=n(),
    unsolved_homicides = sum(disposition %in% c("Closed without arrest", "Open/No arrest"))
  )
```

For the city of Baltimore, MD, use the prop.test function to estimate
the proportion of homicides that are unsolved; save the output of
prop.test as an R object, apply the broom::tidy to this object and pull
the estimated proportion and confidence intervals from the resulting
tidy dataframe.

``` r
balt_df=
  prop.test(
    x=hom_df |> filter(city_state=="Baltimore, MD") |> pull(unsolved_homicides), 
    n=hom_df |> filter(city_state=="Baltimore, MD") |> pull(tot_homicides)) |> 
  broom::tidy()

balt_df |> 
  knitr::kable() 
```

|  estimate | statistic | p.value | parameter |  conf.low | conf.high | method                                               | alternative |
|----------:|----------:|--------:|----------:|----------:|----------:|:-----------------------------------------------------|:------------|
| 0.6455607 |   239.011 |       0 |         1 | 0.6275625 | 0.6631599 | 1-sample proportions test with continuity correction | two.sided   |

``` r
balt_df |> 
  pull(estimate) 
```

    ##         p 
    ## 0.6455607

``` r
balt_df |> 
  pull(conf.low)
```

    ## [1] 0.6275625

``` r
balt_df |> 
  pull(conf.high)
```

    ## [1] 0.6631599

Now run prop.test for each of the cities in your dataset, and extract
both the proportion of unsolved homicides and the confidence interval
for each. Do this within a “tidy” pipeline, making use of purrr::map,
purrr::map2, list columns and unnest as necessary to create a tidy
dataframe with estimated proportions and CIs for each city.

``` r
results_df=
  hom_df |> 
  mutate(
    prop_table=map2(unsolved_homicides, tot_homicides, ~prop.test(x=.x, n=.y)),
    tidy=map(prop_table, broom::tidy)) |> 
  select(-prop_table) |> 
  unnest(cols = c(tidy)) |> 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high) 
```

    ## Warning: There was 1 warning in `mutate()`.
    ## ℹ In argument: `prop_table = map2(unsolved_homicides, tot_homicides,
    ##   ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y))`.
    ## Caused by warning in `prop.test()`:
    ## ! Chi-squared approximation may be incorrect

Create a plot that shows the estimates and CIs for each city – check out
geom_errorbar for a way to add error bars based on the upper and lower
limits. Organize cities according to the proportion of unsolved
homicides.

``` r
results_df |> 
  arrange(estimate) |> 
  mutate(city_state = factor(city_state, levels = city_state)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x=city_state, y=estimate))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high), width = 0.2)+
  coord_flip()+
    labs(
    title = "Proportion of Unsolved Homicides by City",
    x = "City",
    y = "Estimated Proportion (with 95% CI)"
  )
```
